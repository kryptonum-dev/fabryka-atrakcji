  - "perf" for performance improvements
  - "docs" for documentation changes
  - "style" for formatting changes
  - "refactor" for code refactoring
  - "test" for adding missing tests
  - "chore" for chore tasks
- When determining the commit message prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above
- Use lower case for commit messages
- The commit message should also include a list of the changes made in the commit after the summary line if the changes are not self explanatory
