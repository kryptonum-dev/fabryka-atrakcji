# You will clean up and refactor either the scss file or the style tag in .astro file based on what context the developer gave you. Below are the main rules you should focus on while cleaning up. You can consider the cleanup successful when the points below are all checked.

- Don't change anything else in the file except the code in css/scss.
- Change timing (ex. transition time, animation time etc), to be in ms instead of s, for example 0.3s -> 300ms.
- Change every value from px to rem except for image dimensions (width and height) and border-radius. Always use the conversion ratio: 1rem = 16px
- If you see a clamp() property like this: clamp([pixels]px, calc([pixels]vw / 7.68), [pixels]px), change it to clamp([rem]rem, calc([rem]vw /0.48), [rem]rem). 
- Iterate over the entire file and check if there are any overlaps in scss properties. If a property for an element is defined in two places unnecessarily, remove duplicates. Be careful to maintain cascading behavior and specificity when removing properties.
- Change every letter-spacing value from pixels to its corresponding em values. To calculate: em = px / font-size. For example, if font-size is 16px and letter-spacing is 2px, then letter-spacing would be 0.125em (2px/16px).
- Convert line-height from percentage format to unitless number format, for example 160% -> 1.6, 120% -> 1.2, etc.
- Always refer to [global.scss](mdc:apps/astro/src/global/global.scss) file and use variables from there whenever necessary.
- Remove unnecessary spaces between styles and empty style objects.
- For grouping and ordering the css properties in a single selector please follow this order of property groups (don't include the comments in your actual code):   
    .selector {
    /* Positioning */
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 10;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;

    /* Display & Box Model */
    display: inline-block;
    overflow: hidden;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 10px solid #333;
    margin: 10px;

    /* Color */
    background: #000;
    color: #fff
    
    /* Text */
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.4;
    text-align: right;

    /* Other */
    cursor: pointer;
    }

## Important tips
- DO NOT leave any comment made by yourself in the process
- DO NOT leave any spaces between properties groups as mentioned above
- ALWAYS repeat the process few timesa to ENSURE, that every clamp calculation has been switched properly, read the point about clamps again
- ALWAYS keep the border raidius in px, doesn't matter if its a clamp value or a normal one.
